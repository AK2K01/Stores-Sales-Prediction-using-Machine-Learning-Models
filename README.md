# Stores-Sales-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Models
## Problem Statement
Nowadays, Shopping Malls and Big Marts keep track of individual item sales data in order to forecast future client demand and adjust inventory management. In a data warehouse, these data stores hold a significant amount of consumer information and particular item details. By mining the datastore from the data warehouse, more anomalies and common patterns can be discovered.

## Approach

### Classical Machine Learning Tasks: 
1. Data Exploration
2. Data Cleaning
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Building
5. Model Testing
